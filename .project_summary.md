# PostApp Project Summary

## Project Overview

PostApp is a modern React Native social media application built with Expo and Supabase. The application provides core social media functionality including user authentication, post creation, social interactions, and user profiles.

## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6 with stack and tab navigators
- **UI Components**: Custom components with React Native's built-in components
- **Icons**: Expo Vector Icons (@expo/vector-icons)

### Backend Architecture

- **Backend Service**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database, authentication, real-time subscriptions)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with email/password
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for image uploads (planned)

## Key Features

### Authentication System

- Email/password registration and login
- Session management with Supabase Auth
- Automatic session restoration
- Secure logout functionality

### Social Media Features

- **Posts Feed**: Display posts from all users with pagination
- **Post Creation**: Create text posts with optional image support
- **Like System**: Like/unlike posts with real-time updates
- **User Profiles**: View user information and post statistics
- **Comments**: Database schema ready for comments feature

### User Interface

- **Modern Design**: Clean, intuitive interface
- **Theme Support**: Light/Dark mode switching
- **Internationalization**: Vietnamese and English language support
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on various screen sizes
- **Smooth Navigation**: Tab-based navigation with stack navigation

### Settings & Customization

- Theme switching (Light/Dark mode)
- Language selection (Vietnamese/English)
- User account management
- App information and help sections

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

1. **users** - User profile information
2. **posts** - User posts with content and metadata
3. **likes** - Post like relationships
4. **comments** - Post comments (schema ready)

### Key Relationships

- Users can have many posts
- Posts can have many likes and comments
- Many-to-many relationship between users and posts through likes

## Technical Implementation

### Navigation Flow

1. **AppNavigator**: Main navigator that switches between Auth and Main flows
2. **AuthNavigator**: Handles login/register screens
3. **MainNavigator**: Tab navigator for main app screens

### State Management

- Local state with React hooks
- Authentication state managed globally
- Real-time updates through Supabase subscriptions

### API Integration

- Supabase client for all backend operations
- Service layer architecture for clean separation
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety

## Security Features

- Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
- Secure authentication flow
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protected routes and screens

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient re-rendering with React hooks
- Optimized image loading and caching
- Pagination for large data sets
- Lazy loading of non-critical components

## Future Enhancements

- Image upload functionality
- Push notifications
- Real-time messaging
- Advanced search and filtering
- Social features (follow/unfollow)
- Post sharing capabilities
- Comment system implementation
